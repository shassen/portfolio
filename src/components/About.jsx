        Upon graduating from Kent State University in Ohio with a Bachelors degree in Finance, I quickly realized
        my passions didn't include calculating ROIs or betas but rather fitness, music and
        technology.
        <br />

        Crunch Fitness HQ in NYC is where I
        established myself as an accountant, tracking cash for the fitness behemoth. My colleauges were great and the
        atmosphere was energetic, but something was missing - passion. Simply placing myself in the fitness industry
        didn't change the fact that I was eager for more than what accounting could offer.
        <br />
        <br />
        My next move was a lateral one, but still exciting because I transitioned out of the fitness industry and into technology.
        Learnvest, also located in NYC, was a start-up created for millenials to track their finances in the digital space.
        Without even realizing it, I took up a strong interest in programming because I was surrounded by software engineers.
        I would go home after work and learn as much as a I could about coding principals. The software engineers at Learnvest
        suggested I learn Javascript, so I did! For six months I practiced coding every night and quickly fell in love with the craft.
        <br />
        <br />
        Insert General Assembly. I decided to take a leap of faith and enrolled in a web development bootcamp at GA, a 12-week 
        immersive program designed to teach students the skills to thrive as a software developer. Here, I learned how to 
        effectively use HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Node, Express, React, PostgreSQL, Ruby on Rails and design principals to build
        creative web pages and apps.
