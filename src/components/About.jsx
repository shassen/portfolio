      <p className="profile-bio">I am a proactive web developer committed to the pursuit of debugged applications through concise, clean and intentional code. I have experience working with both front and back-end techniques, and enjoy both as they present unique challenges to solve. 
         My experience in finance has created a passion for working with data and developing solutions for automating mundane workflows. My favorite aspect of web development is that I have the ability to mold the future of technology and build a better world. Letâ€™s build a better future together.
